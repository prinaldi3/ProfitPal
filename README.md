# PP (ProfitPal)

A python-based CLI application for logging crucial gig information, generating easy-to-read summaries of financial data, updating account information, and projecting future profits.

# Installation

As per the description above, you will need to have python installed. If you don't have it, I think you can just do pip install python in your terminal? I'm lazy, use google.

1) Open up your terminal, and navigate to wherever you have installed this software. 
2) pip install .
3) Now, you should be able to run commands like 'pp log -m 7 -d 12 --amt 100'
4) Start by running pp --help to see all available commands and their arguments
